# StopClock
## Description  

The **Stopwatch Application** is a simple and interactive web tool designed to measure elapsed time accurately. It provides functionalities to start, stop, and reset the timer. The project is built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, ensuring a responsive and visually appealing user interface.  

- **JavaScript** handles the stopwatch logic, including real-time updates, formatted time display (hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds), and event-driven interactions through buttons.  
- **CSS** provides a modern, clean, and responsive design with a central focus on usability and aesthetics. The timer and buttons are styled to adapt seamlessly across various devices, enhancing user experience.  

This project is ideal for understanding how to use JavaScript for time-based operations and integrating dynamic functionalities with responsive web design.
